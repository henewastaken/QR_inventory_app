# QR_inventory_app

Android inventory application.
Idea id to create database where user can store data items by using qr codes
and getting information about the item and how much of item is left.

Example use case:
User prints QR code for bag of flower, adds it to the app and a warning limit, 
when need to buy more.
When user uses flower, qr is scanned and amount taken is imputted.
When user goes to store user can with single button press get all items that are
under the warning limit so user knows to buy more of those items.
Also comments can be inserted to each item, i.e. coockig time for rice..
